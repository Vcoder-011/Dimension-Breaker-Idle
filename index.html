        <p>You are a 1st dimenesional god like entity. You don't know why you are here but you know you don't like being only long, you want width and height and even more!<br> You can make matter/darkmatter with the engery that produces from your body. It is little now, but with time you can produce more energy and produce more matter. <br>(Little note:The laws of the universe do not apply to you.)</p>
